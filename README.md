MetflixDB is a comprehensive database management system for managing movie-related data, developed as part of a 10-week academic project. This repository showcases the development of a full-stack application, integrating a relational database with a user-friendly web interface. The project spans the entire database lifecycle, from logical design to implementation, normalization, and final deployment.

Key Features:
- Relational Database Design: Designed and implemented a database in Oracle with 5-10 entities and their relationships, normalized to 3NF/BCNF for optimal performance and data integrity.
- CRUD Operations: Built dynamic features for creating, reading, updating, and deleting movie records via a secure and interactive web application.
- Web Application: Developed using Flask (backend) and Bootstrap (frontend), providing responsive design and seamless navigation.
- Advanced SQL Queries: Implemented complex queries with joins, grouping, and views to generate meaningful insights from the database.
- Unix Shell Integration: Text-based menu functionalities for database operations, showcasing command-line interactions.

Technologies Used:
- Backend: Python (Flask, WTForms)
- Frontend: HTML/CSS, Bootstrap
- Database: Oracle DB, SQL
- APIs: TMDB API for movie data integration
- Development Tools: Unix Shell for command-line UI, Flask-Session for user session management
